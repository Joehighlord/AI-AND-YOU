# Project Outline

OMEN systems is aiming to create an Artificial Intelligence that can study people and designers and how they interact with the world, then design solutions to meet their needs.&#x20;

## The Story

In the world of 2030, AI tools have become an accepted part of the design process. In Particular the areas of diffusion models and natural language processing.&#x20;

This has led designers to wonder if the future of design lies in the actions of the designer and the user. Can the AI study the person and create the things, or at least the ideas for the things people really need.

## The Questions

How can the unconscious actions of the designer be collected to form a design?

How can the designer interact with the AI design process through non-text means?&#x20;

How can you 'engineer' actions around design?

Can Stable Diffusion Design around emotions?&#x20;

How can we mix and match the AI designed robots to make bigger an bolder robots!

The smart Home - BUT FOR A DESIGNER!

## **The Project**

The goal of this project is to investigate the different ways designers can interface with both AI design tools such as Stable Diffusion as well as interface with design itself. This project will look into the 'smart home for designers'&#x20;

## The tasks

1. Create a model a week that demonstrates a different point
2. Create a 'design  through action' AI workflow&#x20;
3. Apply traditional product design methods to this workflow
4. Demonstrate and refine prompt engineering&#x20;
5. Demonstrate how this can all be done from home.&#x20;

### FUTURE SCENARIOS&#x20;

### The Designers Smart Home&#x20;

Jonathan is a designer in 2040. The AI design revolution changed a lot. Jonathan remembers when he had to sketch out his ideas and render things in Bender. Now, as a prompt engineer for OMEN Systems - the company responsible for revolutionising AI healthcare with OMEN1.  He uses text and reference images to guide AI image generation tools in design of new things!&#x20;

But new technology is on the horizon. Jonathans job as a prompt engineer is at risk to the new 'design through actions' technologies allow people to preform AI design without even using text! A range of 'design assistants' can now watch designers like Jonathan. How he talks, how he walks, what he does for leisure and how he does his work - and design for him based on this information.&#x20;

**This is called Design through action.**&#x20;

## The devices!

### **Therapy 3D Printer**

Imagine you come home from a stressful day as an accountant. You walk through the door and collapse on the sofa. The Therapy 3D printer rolls over and asks how the day was.&#x20;

You tell it about your woes, about how Bob the builder at work is a bastard ect. The printer takes this and uses AI to design and rapidly print you a thingy to make you feel better!&#x20;

#### Examples of the thingies

{% hint style="warning" %}
Consider how to translate upset peoples babble into working AI prompts
{% endhint %}

**Daily Solution Construction Companion**

* Watches you throughout the day
* What problems do you face?
* How do you overcome them?&#x20;
* Uses this information to suggest design solutions to solve your problems and communicates this to the Therapy 3D printer

**The Design prompt Toaster**

Basically just AI generates you inspiring design prompts for the day.

**The robot hat follows you around and does the chores you forget.**&#x20;

**Mild Inconvenience logger WHICH ARE EARINGS**&#x20;

This device lives in your ear and listens to you all day. Every time you say something like 'why can't the council do this' or 'why don't they just...'. It takes note. It builds a library of your random gripes and suggestions for the world and eventually builds you a design brief solution.&#x20;

## Notes

Domic Willcox&#x20;

David Schridly&#x20;

Consider the relationship with these devices. Is it a parent, a friend? a God?&#x20;

Watch 'Humans'&#x20;

Look into Ubiquitous computing - Dourish and Bell, weiner&#x20;

Ambient Intelligence

DON'T LOSE THE WORD INTERFACE!!!

How can technology be 'sculptural'

Embodied Cognition

For E Cognition  &#x20;

### Pitch Questions

What kind of designer am I?

What do I believe in?&#x20;

What do I want to do?&#x20;

What makes this new?&#x20;

What project type is this? The future scenarios

How will you know its  success. Who will you ask

What will this project do for you? What are the outcomes? &#x20;
