I used HeroForge to create my own Dungeons and Dragons character.

1. Good interface that can be understood at a glace
2. Vast range of options covering many fantasy races and styles
3. No restrictions on creativity, the services advices on looks, but never restricts

### Business Model:&#x20;

Hero Forge allows customers to either buy their custom minifigures in a range of qualities, or purchase the STL file or 3D digital file with textures to be used for online tabletop simulators. There is also a subscription model for the digital files where customers get 5 unique figure files a month.&#x20;

> Our online store broadly maintained the step change from £50 million in 2019/20 to £90 million delivered in 2020/21 and £85 million in 2021/22 and with retail and trade in double digit growth, I see that as a success (a reminder our online store does not offer a discount off the RRP, most trade accounts do).
