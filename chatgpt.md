### Defining Design Fiction

Can you describe 'Speculative Design Fiction'

ChatGPT

Speculative design fiction is an approach to design that combines the elements of speculative fiction and design thinking to imagine and explore possible futures. It involves using design techniques to create artifacts, scenarios, or narratives that provoke thought and discussion about the social, cultural, and technological implications of emerging technologies or alternative future scenarios.

Speculative design fiction can take many forms, including product prototypes, service models, visualizations, or speculative stories. The aim is to stimulate imagination, explore possibilities, and generate critical reflections on the present and the future. This approach often involves collaborating with experts from diverse fields, such as science, social sciences, arts, and humanities, to ensure that the scenarios developed are grounded in reality and explore important social issues and concerns.

In summary, speculative design fiction uses design thinking and storytelling techniques to create artifacts and scenarios that imagine alternative futures and provoke critical reflection on the social and cultural implications of emerging technologies or alternative future scenarios.

&#x20;      What is an example of a speculative visualisation?

ChatGPT

One example of a speculative visualization is the "Hyper-Reality" video by Keiichi Matsuda, which presents a dystopian vision of the future where augmented reality technology has become ubiquitous and integrated into every aspect of daily life.

The video depicts a world where information and advertisements bombard people at every turn, and individuals are constantly navigating a complex network of digital overlays and interfaces. The protagonist of the video, played by an actress, moves through this hyper-real environment, interacting with holographic advertisements, tracking her daily activities with wearable devices, and experiencing sensory overload from the constant stimulation of augmented reality.

The video serves as a warning about the potential negative consequences of technology and how it can transform our lived experience. By visualizing a possible future, it prompts viewers to consider the ethical and social implications of emerging technologies and the kind of world we want to create.

ChatGPT

Sure, an example of a speculative product prototype is the "Moxie" social companion robot designed by the Boston-based start-up Embodied.

Moxie is designed to be a friendly companion for children, using advanced AI technology to engage in conversation, play games, and teach important life skills. The robot is designed to help children develop social and emotional skills by encouraging them to engage in activities and conversations that promote empathy, kindness, and positive behaviors.

The Moxie robot is a speculative product prototype because it is not yet available for sale but is instead a conceptual design that represents a potential future product. The design of the robot is based on the latest research in child development and social robotics, and it represents an innovative approach to using technology to promote positive social and emotional outcomes.

Speculative product prototypes like Moxie are important because they allow designers and engineers to explore new ideas and technologies in a safe and controlled environment. By creating these prototypes, designers can test and refine their ideas before bringing them to market, ensuring that they are well-designed, user-friendly, and aligned with the needs and values of their intended users.

ChatGPT

Certainly! One example of a speculative product story is the "Peeback" wall coating developed by the German-based advertising agency, Hamburg Action Against Rubbish (HAR).

The Peeback wall coating is a water-repellent surface applied to the walls of public restrooms in busy areas of the city. The coating is designed to prevent people from urinating on the walls by causing the urine to splash back onto the person who is urinating. This is achieved through a hydrophobic coating that causes the urine to bounce back, creating an unpleasant and embarrassing experience for the offender.

The Peeback wall coating is a speculative product story because it is not a real product, but rather a fictional design concept intended to spark discussion and raise awareness about the problem of public urination in cities. By presenting a solution to a common social problem, the Peeback wall coating encourages people to think creatively about the role of design in addressing social and environmental issues.

Speculative product stories like Peeback can be a powerful tool for promoting social and environmental change. By imagining a world where new technologies and design solutions are used to solve complex problems, these stories can inspire people to think differently about the world around them and to take action to create a better future.

### Creating a world

Good day ChatGPT. Can you propose a detailed Speculative Design fiction surrounding a design project that aims to improve the interaction, interfacing and feedback given to designers using AI tools. This design project is set in 2030 and so has more advanced technology than today. This speculative design fiction should outline the state of the world, the type of people who work in the design industry at this time, the kind of AI tools they use and the difficulties they may face.

ChatGPT

Sure, I'd be happy to propose a speculative design fiction that fits your criteria!

In the year 2030, the world has experienced significant advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technology. AI-powered tools have become ubiquitous in the design industry, enabling designers to create complex designs quickly and efficiently. However, these tools have also presented significant challenges for designers, including issues with interaction, interfacing, and feedback.

Enter the "AI Design Assistant," a new project designed to improve the interaction, interfacing, and feedback given to designers using AI tools. The AI Design Assistant is a platform that integrates with existing design tools, including Adobe Creative Suite and Sketch, and provides designers with real-time feedback and suggestions.

The team behind the AI Design Assistant includes a diverse group of designers, AI experts, and psychologists who understand the challenges that designers face. The team worked tirelessly to create a platform that not only integrates with existing tools but also understands the unique needs of individual designers.

The AI Design Assistant includes a sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) system that can interpret the context of the designs, the preferences of the designer, and the design goals to provide tailored suggestions. The platform uses advanced machine learning algorithms to learn from designers' behavior, preferences, and feedback to improve its suggestions over time.

The AI Design Assistant also includes a virtual reality (VR) component that enables designers to immerse themselves in their designs and make real-time adjustments. The VR component provides a more intuitive and immersive way for designers to interact with their designs, making it easier to identify and address design issues.

One of the key benefits of the AI Design Assistant is its ability to provide designers with instant feedback on their designs. The platform analyzes designs in real-time and provides suggestions for improvement. This feedback loop enables designers to make more informed decisions and iterate on their designs more quickly.

Another benefit of the AI Design Assistant is its ability to reduce the cognitive load on designers. The platform automates many of the repetitive and time-consuming tasks that designers typically perform, enabling them to focus on more complex design challenges. This automation also enables designers to work more efficiently, reducing the time and resources required to complete a project.

The AI Design Assistant has been well-received by designers, who appreciate the platform's ability to streamline their workflows, provide real-time feedback, and improve their designs. The platform has also been praised for its ability to personalize suggestions and adapt to individual designers' needs.

As the design industry continues to evolve, the AI Design Assistant will play an increasingly important role in improving designers' interaction, interfacing, and feedback with AI tools. With its advanced NLP system, machine learning algorithms, and VR component, the AI Design Assistant is poised to become a critical tool for designers in the years to come.
