# Product Brief and Design Specification

**Type: Open and Expansive**

## **Product Brief**

How can the interface, interaction and feedback with AI Art and Design tools be improved for non-programmers by using intuitive and mechanical controls. Ideally aimed at character designers and the figurine market.&#x20;

#### **How can AI design be made more intuitive to designers?**&#x20;

### What

An new way of interacting with AI design tools that doesn't include inputting text, or needing an understanding of programming or the code behind Stable Diffusion.&#x20;

## Where and When and why? - Validation of Project

This project is speculative, it is positioned in the near future when AI Art has not only become widely accepted, but new careers are starting to form around it - 'Prompt Engineers'. Professionals who specialise in interacting with AI Design tools.&#x20;

This product will serve as a built of hardware used by these prompt engineers to help them do their work without needing advanced programming knowledge.&#x20;

### Speculative Future Position

### Product Position within the market - Why

'In 2018 the art world was taken by storm when a new medium entered the market. [_Portrait of Edmond Belamy_](https://www.christies.com/en/lot/lot-6166184), by Paris-based [Obvious](https://obvious-art.com/) sold at a Christie’s auction for $432,500.' (The Art Market, 2022)

'World renowned [Zaha Hadid Architects](https://www.zaha-hadid.com/) have employed AI in the design and building of [Bee’ah](https://www.beeahgroup.com/)’s new company headquarters in the United Arab Emirates, incorporating the software to create a building symbiotic to its surroundings. Design icon Philippe Starck released the [AI chair for Kartell](https://www.starck.com/a-i-introducing-the-first-chair-created-with-artificial-intelligence-p3801) in 2019. The chair was designed entirely by artificial intelligence to provide the most ergonomic, comfortable piece of furniture'(The Art Market, 2022)



'[_Expressionism AI_](https://aiartshop.com/collections/expressionism-ai), for example, of entirely artificially created works. Each unique piece is sold in the region of $45 - $70, with the option for the work to also be made into an [NFT](https://www.artsper-for-galleries.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-nfts-for-galleries-and-artists).'

> worth £460 million dollars in 2022 with an expected growth of 4.7% between 2022 and 2027&#x20;

## Deliverables

### Must

Simplify the interface of Stable Diffusion to be understood by non-programmers.

Reduce the overall functionality, with the aim of streamlining it for designers.

Replace ambiguous and unclear functions such as the Classifier Free Guidance with mechanical components. LIKE THE CHOAS LEVER!&#x20;

Be updateable as the technology of AI Art progresses&#x20;

### Should

If possible, remove the need for text prompts and ‘prompt engineering’ completely.

Be modifiable by programmers for the specific needs of the office.&#x20;

### Must Not

* REQUIRE any coding to function at advertised level
* Need disassembly or be difficult to move
* Limit create expression

### Measures of Success

* Can the device be understood by both non-programmers, and people who are familiar with Stable Diffusion
* Allows for the effective integration of Stable Diffusion into the design process
* Allows for manual control of elements such as lighting, reflection, envirnment and pose.



### Maintenance and Upgrades

As this is a physical bit of hardware, it will need maintaining much like any PC does; Dusiting, cleaning, thermal paste re-application etc

## Environment - Physical contraints and conditions

### Home Office&#x20;

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Home Office.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

1. Desk top sized
2. Interfaces with a desktop PC or Laptop
3. Requires a built in way of controlling lighting to view hologram or adjust internal lighting

### Studio



### Visual Language

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Printer Examples.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

1. Two Primary colours&#x20;
2. Chamfered or radiused Edges
3. Does not hid the primary mechanism

### Ergonomics

The pulleys and dials need to be usable by people without cutting them open. Spinning wheels need to be used with one finger.&#x20;

The object itself will be large enough for the user to grip parts comfortably, but it can also be kept on a shelf (and taken to interviews)

### Packaging&#x20;

A design box delivered in a designed box

## Other Factors&#x20;

Customers&#x20;

Competition

Demand/Quantity&#x20;

Estimated Production Cost

Testing
