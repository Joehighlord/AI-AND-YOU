WELCOME TO THE FUTURE!

Hi, my name is Joe. Founder of OMEN Systems and creator of OMEN1 - A personal healthcare assistant powered by Artificial Intelligence. Ever since OMEN1 hit the market last year (2030 by the way) people have been asking what's next for the innovators at OMEN Systems!&#x20;

WELL!&#x20;

Let me introduce ControlForge! An innovative method of interfacing with AI design tools that anyone, even your mother, can understand!&#x20;

ControlForge takes many of the obtuse and complex features of Ai art and design and gives them a  physical form.&#x20;

In 2022, AI art really hit the mainstream with things like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion. These tool relied on:

Text Prompting and prompt weighting

Checkpoint models and LoRA's

Image uploading

Samplers and Classifer Free Guidence

And something called 'ControlNET'&#x20;

ControlForge aims to condense all of these functions into something intuitive to use, physical but doesn't limit the creative output of AI design.

This model is aimed at being part of a character designers workflow, but the technology can be applied to any area of product design.&#x20;

But how does it work?&#x20;

ControlForge is largely based on ControlNET. A feature of stable diffusion mentioned before. You first put a 'base model' - in this case OMEN1 - into the unit. This is roughly the equivalent to uploading an image into Stable Diffusion.&#x20;

But instead of typing some long and nonsense text prompt and prompt weighting. ControlForge gets its additional information from placing other figures into the two weighting units.&#x20;

The ControlForge AI model will use these two weighting cylinders and the figures within in to get pose, colour and detail information.&#x20;

The how much 'weight' is taken from these figures can be controlled by physically pushing down the weighting units. As the unit is pushed down, more and more data is taken from the figure.&#x20;

When happy with the weighting of a figure. It can be locked in by pressing the button on the front, and the figure can be changed out with another one.

ControlFOrge projects the generation of these models as a hologram. This hologram changes in real time as the weighting units are adjusted. These figures were used to generate a new concept for the next OMEN unit. WHich we're calling in house - OMEN Prime.&#x20;

As shown, as the 'pose figure' is given more weight, the pose of OMEN Prime becomes more and more similar to it.&#x20;
