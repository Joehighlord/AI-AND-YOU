## Task Analysis

1. Insert any backgrounds needed into the photo studio
2. Place the product/character figure into the 'photo studio'
3. Set the lighting using either the area light (LED strip), Spot Light (Torch) etc.
4. Hologram shows the current design with lighting and basic environment
5. Functions of Stable Diffusion are represented with the interface panel on the front
6. As the user interfaces with the device, the holographic character design changes in real time to reflect the application of AI.&#x20;
7. When the design is correct, PUSH THE BIG RED BUTTON
8. The design is sliced with organic supports (Prusa Slicer) and printed.&#x20;
