### Systemic Bias in AI Data

{% embed url="https://medium.com/ai-art-creators/prompting-for-diversity-in-ai-art-d72d1682ffd8" %}

In current AI models such as MidJourney, Diversity is something that must be prompted for. Without including any indication of Ethnicity with the prompt, different models will have a different 'base line'&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Include a comparison between prompts without using any diversity prompt.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

But even with 'diversity prompts', some words are attached to specific cultures such as Calypso and carnival (Torcello 2022). If you want to create diverse characters, it can be difficult to know which words to include.&#x20;

### How to Design Race into the interface:

* Random race button!&#x20;
* flick the 'white person' switch and then adjust the level of whiteness with the lever.
* Describe the culture in words and the AI creates something.&#x20;

## Task Analysis

1. Insert any backgrounds needed into the photo studio
2. Place the product/character figure into the 'photo studio'
3. Set the lighting using either the area light (LED strip), Spot Light (Torch) etc.
4. Hologram shows the current design with lighting and basic environment
5. Functions of Stable Diffusion are represented with the interface panel on the front
6. As the user interfaces with the device, the holographic character design changes in real time to reflect the application of AI.&#x20;
7. When the design is correct, PUSH THE BIG RED BUTTON
8. The design is sliced with organic supports (Prusa Slicer) and printed.&#x20;
