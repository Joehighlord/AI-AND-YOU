Diffusion models such as Stable DIffusion use AI models trained on images scrapped from the internet, often without the consent or knowledge of the artist.

Fine tuned models, such as LoRA's are made by adding images of a specific thing, or character to a existing model. This allows for generations of that thing.&#x20;

While all AI output is unique, it can't be argued that LoRA's don't rely on copyrighted images.
